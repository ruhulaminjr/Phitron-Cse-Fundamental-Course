/*
3	Farina is a hard worker. But she also loves shopping a lot. Each day she earns some money and spends some on shopping. Fortunately, she has a credit card without any restrictions (it can have any amount of negative/positive balance). Initially, her credit card has a balance of 0. But she becomes UPSET when her credit card balance goes negative otherwise, she remains HAPPY.

Input:

The first line contains a number of Test Case T. Each of the test cases contains the following lines:
The first line contains the number of days D when Farina has earned some money.
The next line contains D space-separated integers indexed from 0 to D-1 which denotes the amount earned by Farina on an ith day.
The next line contains D space-separated integers indexed from 0 to D-1 which denotes the amount spent by Farina for shopping on an ith day.
The next line contains an integer Q that denotes the number of queries.
Each of the following Q lines contains an integer x denoting the query of the status of Farina.
Output:
For each Test case there will be a new line where For each query Print 0 if Farina is UPSET otherwise print 1.

Number of days: 5

Farina's expense: 8 15 1 2 10
Number of queries: 3

After 0th day Farina's balance is (10 â€“ 8) = 2 which is positive, so she is HAPPY.

After 1st day Farina's balance is (10+5 - 8 - 15) = -8 which is negative, so she is UPSET.

After 1st day Farina's balance is (10+1 - 7 - 4) = 0 which is not negative, so she is HAPPY.
