pseudo code 

input : a Weighted graph as an adjacency matrix
output: shortest path from all Node

-> create a distance_matrix "d" and set  d[i][j] = x
   where there is direct edge from node "i" to node 'j" and cost is "x"
-> for all node "i" d[i][i] = 0 
-> for all nodes "u" & "j" where there isn't any direct edge from "u" to "v"
    set d[u][v] = INF

for all node "K"
    - for all node "U"
     - for all node "v"
        - d[u][v] = min(d[u][v],d[u][v] + d[k][v])

- output all pair shortest distance "d"
